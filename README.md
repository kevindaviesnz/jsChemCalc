### Standards

Note: If what the function does is obvious without using a prefix then do not add a prefix.

Use **"determine<X>"** as a prefix if the function or method will use logic to decide X. X should be a *single* item from a list of possible values.

use **"fetchX"** where the function or method will *fetch* a single value. Unlike "determine<X>" the function or method should
NOT "decide" what particular value to return from a list of possible values. The return value can be an array.

Use **"getX"** to get data or values where there is very little if any logic involved. Usually this will involve an object or
data structure.

Use **"tryX"** to test something before actually doing it. This should cause no changes.

Use **"generateX"** where the function will be generating a new value and returning it.

Use **"constructX"** where the function will be "constructing" a whole value from two or more values.

Use **XIsY** where the function will return a boolean depending on whether <X> is <Y>.

Use **"extractXFromY"** where the function will be "extracting" a value from another value.
