In typical aqueous solutions, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong acid and exists primarily in its protonated form ([H3O]+ and [HSO4]-). It does not readily donate protons to species like CN. The pKa values and the thermodynamic conditions play a crucial role in determining whether such reactions occur.
