// Cannot protonate a nitrogen where there is positive charged oxygen
// eg CC(C)[N-]C[O+] ->  CC(C)NC[O+]
// ref ProtonationReverse()

// Cannot do proton transfer where nitrogen or the oxygen has a double bond
// Cannot to proton transfer where the positive nitrogen has two or more non-terminal carbon bonds.

// When doing 1,2 addition using nitrogen atom (on reagent) the nitrogen atom must have at least one hydrogen.

// Protonatoin - if oxygen on double bond then protonate the oxygen and not the nitrogen

// Water can't be a Lewis base.
