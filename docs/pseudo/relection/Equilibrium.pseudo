FUNCTION Equilibrum (reactants:array, products: array, logger: object)

   SET reverse to FALSE
   equilibrium constant = CALCULATE equilibrium constant
   GET whether products favored over reactants OR reactants favored over products
   ratio = GET ratio of products to reactants
   IF products favored AND ratio < 1 OR ratio < equilibrium constant ratio
       reverse = CALCULATE chance of reaction not occuring due to equilibrium
   END IF

   RETURN reverse

END FUNCTION
