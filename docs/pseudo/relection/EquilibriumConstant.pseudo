# Define a function to calculate the equilibrium constant (Keq) for an acid-base reaction
FUNCTION EquilibriumConstant(acid: object, conjugate acid: object):

    # Step 1: Look up the pKa values of the acid and conjugate acid.
    # These values should be known or looked up from a reference source.

    # Step 2: Subtract pKa of the conjugate acid from pKa of the acid
    pKaDifference = conjugate acid pKa - acid pka

    # Step 3: Calculate Keq from pKa difference using the antilogarithm formula
    Keq = 10 raised to the power of (-pKaDifference)

    return Keq

END FUNCTION

# Example usage:

acid = acetic acid
base = ammonia
conjugate acid = conjugate acid of ammonia (ammonia is a base)
equilibriumConstant = EquilibriumConstant(acid, conjugate acid)
PRINT "The equilibrium constant (Keq) is " + equilibriumConstant formatted with 5 decimal places

# products favoured
GET RANDOM number BETWEEN 1 AND equilibrium constant
IF pka of acid > pka of conjugate of acid AND pka of base > pKa of conjugate of base AND random number <> equilibrium constant
    OR pka of acid < pka of conjugate of acid AND random number = equilibrium constant:
         PRINT "Proceeding with reaction"

Following Steps 1 through 3, we have pKeq 5 4.76 2 9.24 5 24.48, so Keq 5 3.0 3 104. Because we know that
acid-base reactions are favored when the stronger acid reacts with the stronger base to give the weaker acid
and the weaker base, we can conclude that the equilibrium for the reaction between acetic acid and ammonia lies
to the right. Using the mathematical approach just developed, we can calculate that the preference to the right
is 3.0 3 104. This means that if we started with equal amounts of acetic acid and ammonia, the reaction
would prefer the products 30,000 to 1.
